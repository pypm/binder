# quickstart
You can start the ipypm GUI right away by using a jupyter hub server.
Click on one of the following links to get started!

* [Binder](binder/README.md) - an ephemeral service
intended for relatively short sessions
* Jupyter hub
  * The Canada-wide [syzygy.ca network](syzygy/README.md)

Thanks to Ian Allison for help setting up the one-click links to the ipypm GUI.
