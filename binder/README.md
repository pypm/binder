Binder notebooks for quick start

Start the ipypm GUI:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pypm/quickstart/master?filepath=binder%2Fipypm-quickstart.ipynb)

The first time you do this, it may take a minute or so to create the
environment (installing the software). Your instance will be disconnected
if it is left idle. If you click on the link again,
you will be reconnected to the environment setup for you.

Binder is a great way to quickly try out the ipypm GUI.

For a more traditional working environment, in which
notebooks and other files you create
are saved for future use, you can:
* use a jupyter hub such as syzygy.ca:
