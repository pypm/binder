# quickstart for Binder

Start the ipypm GUI by clicking this button ->
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pypm/quickstart/master?filepath=binder%2Fipypm-quickstart.ipynb)

The first time you do this, it may take a minute or so to create the
environment (installing the software). Your instance will be disconnected
if it is left idle for more than 10 minutes. 

[Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
is a great way to quickly try out the ipypm GUI.
It aims to provide up to 12 hours of session time per user session.

For a more traditional working environment, in which
notebooks and other files you create
are saved for future use, you can:
* use a jupyter hub such as syzygy.ca:
