    "## Detecting rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants with case data\n",
    "D. Karlen (+ S. Otto)/ Feb 14, 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "Rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants dramatically affect the growth rate of detected cases in afflicted jurisdictions.\n",
    "This report demonstrates that the nature of the transition to higher growth,\n",
    "due to the introduction of the B.1.1.7 variant, is\n",
    "significantly different, both in magnitude and shape, than transitions resulting from changes in general public behaviour.\n",
    "As a result, the presence of the variant can be detected using population-level case data, after it has become dominant, without genomic screening or specialized PCR tests.\n",
    "With the case data, the transmission advantage of the variant can be accurately determined, by directly comparing the infection trajectory for the two strains under the same conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this preliminary report, case data timeseries from England and Israel are examined. \n",
    "The PCR tests used in England were able to identify the presence of the rapidly spreading variant, B.1.1.7,\n",
    "and that variant became responsible for half of daily cases by early December.\n",
    "By using case data, we estimate that the efficiency for the PCR tests to identify a sample as the B.1.1.7 variant is 70-80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same growth pattern is seen in the case data timeseries from Israel, suggesting that the variant B.1.1.7 was\n",
    "responsible for half of daily cases at the beginning of November, and would be responsible for nearly all cases in December and\n",
    "beyond.\n",
    "Genomic screenings indicate that the variant represents less than 50% of samples collected in early January 2021,\n",
    "and so further investigations are needed to understand this seeming contradition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case data shows that transmission advantage of the variant is substantialy larger than previous estimates. The US CDC assessment suggested that the variant would grow from 0.5% to 50% of cases about 75 days. That corresponding to the variant having a daily growth rate larger than the original strains by 7.3 % per day. The case data from England and Israel shows that the variant has a daily growth rate advantage of about 13%. With that advantage the variant would grow from 0.5% to 50% of cases in under 45 days."

    "### Method\n",
    "To interpret case data time series, the [pypm](http://www.pypm.ca) population modelling framework is used. Discrete-time difference equations characterize an infection cycle and time delays are included to represent the propogation of populations from infected to contagious to symptomatic to tested and finally to reported. These calculations are either done in terms of expectation values (to define model expectations) or in terms of simulated data using negative binomial, binomial, and multinomial distributions (to evaluate the standard deviations of parameter estimators). The model is tuned to case data by adjusting the transmission rate of the original strains at a few dates, to model changes in public behaviour. The boundary dates for the periods of constant transmission rate are determined in the same fit that estimates the transmission rates.\n",
    "In modelling juridications in North America, Europe, and Israel, the typical length of periods with constant transmission rate is 1-2 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variant is modelled by including a second infection cycle whose contagious population propogates to both the regular reporting and the variant reporting populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sources\n",
    "Publicly available case data time series were used from [England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-novel-sars-cov-2-variant-variant-of-concern-20201201) and [Israel](https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19). \n",
    "Both sources report weekly data, and for the purposes of analysis, the data was spread equally for each day.\n",
    "The data from England includes the number of cases each week that have been identified as the B.1.1.7 variant through their normal PCR testing, and these are divided into the 9 regions of England.\n",
    "Case and first dose vaccination data from Israel, divided into age-groups, is used to study the introduction of the \n",
    "variant and to assess the immunity that the Pfizer vaccine provides the older age-groups against this variant."

    "\n",
    "To identify and measure the effect of the introduction of a rapidly spreading variant using case data time series alone is challenging if there are large reporting anomalies or significant changes in public behaviour during the period the variant is becoming dominant. For three of the UK regions, the data appears to be suitable to estimate the impact on growth of cases, in order to compare with the direct measurement using their PCR data.\n",
